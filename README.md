# Bugler

Bugler is a Ruby Gem that will allow you to quickly and easily create and update static websites. It is ideal for websites hosted on GitHub pages. There is planned support for regular websites as well as blogs.

## Installation

To get started with Bugler, just install the gem:

```
gem install bugler
```

## Use

To create a new Bugler website, use the following:
```
bugler init <NAME>
cd <NAME>
bugler server
```

In the above example, replace `<NAME>` with the name of your project. The `bugler server` command will build the generated website and start a server on your local machine for you to try out!
